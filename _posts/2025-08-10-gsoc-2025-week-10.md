This week, I completed the density component related changes.

I made the following progress:

- PR [#918](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/MolecularNodes/pull/918){:target="_blank"} (open)
  - Added two density annotations - one to show the density grid info and the other to show the axes of a 3D grid
  - Added custom font support for annotations - this works for both the text displayed in the 3D viewport as well as the final renders
  - Added a molecule info annotation to display basic molecule details (mostly to complete the annotation support across other MN entities)
  - Separated annotation types per entity to avoid any name collisions between different entities
  - Added configurable vertical spacing support for annotation text
  - Added tests for the new annotations
- PR [#920](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/MolecularNodes/pull/920){:target="_blank"} (open)
  - Added a new style called `Density ISO Surface` for density grids
  - Support for separate colors for positive and negative ISO values
  - Support for displaying surface contours as a line mesh in 3D viewport
  - Support for slicing the grid along all the three axes in all directions (`left`, `right`, `front`, `back`, `top`, `bottom`)
  - This new style is completely generated from code and not part of MN data file

Here are some learning from this week:

- There is no separate font styling support in Blender (like `Bold`, `Italic` etc) - the corresponding font file has to be loaded if that is needed (using `blf.load`)
- Fonts loaded using `blf.load` have to be unloaded using `blf.unload` with the same font file as the param and not the returned font id from the load
- There is no way to specify a filter for specific files when using Blender's `StringProperty` with subtype `FILE_PATH` directly - users can filter from Blender's file selection GUI
- `Grid` objects of `GridDataFormats` too have an option for custom metadata (similar to `vdb` files) - we use this to keep track of the grid filepath and the import options
- There doesn't seem to be an easy way to link a Geometry Node input to a specific material setting (like say the `use_backface_culling`)
- Using `Ctrl` when placing nodes in the Geometry Nodes editor will ensure snapping to the grid and avoid node locations having floating point values
- `Node To Python` extension allows exporting Geometry Node trees as Python code

Next week, I will initiate discussions on the last item about rendering support for the newly added stuff and get started on them. I will also start a discussion on the panel locations in the 3D viewport n-panel vs the Object Properties.
