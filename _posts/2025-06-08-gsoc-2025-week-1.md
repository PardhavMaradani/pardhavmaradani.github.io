The official coding period for GSoC 2025 started on 2nd June 2025. Here is the Week 1 update for my project:

In the meeting with my mentors [Brady Johnston](https://github.com/bradyajohnston){:target="_blank"} and [Yuxuan Zhuang](https://github.com/yuxuanzhuang){:target="_blank"} during the community bonding period, we discussed about several details of the project and agreed that the code written as part of this project will reside in the [MolecularNodes](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/MolecularNodes){:target="_blank"} repo.

I started off with a [GSoC 2025: High level structure to start with #870](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/MolecularNodes/discussions/870){:target="_blank"} discussion to outline what I would begin with. Based on these discussions, I created a [Basic universe management APIs and GUI
#877 PR](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/MolecularNodes/pull/877){:target="_blank"}. This PR added the following things:

- A base class for MDAnalysis visualization (`MDAVis`)
- A `UniverseManager` class to manage MDAnalysis universes added to Blender
- A `UniverseView` class that is responsible for all display aspects of the universe in Blender
- APIs to add / delete / list / get / clear universes
- Subscriptable and iterable access to the added universes using `UniverseManager` for easy data access
- GUI within Blender for listing and managing (add / delete) the universes and Trajectory info
- An example notebook that shows all the APIs added
- Tests for all the new APIs
- Documentation setup to pull all new APIs added under these classes

Here is a short video that shows the progress made so far:

There were several new things I learnt during this week. Here is a list of a few of them:

- `__init__` will get called everytime a singleton class is instantiated, so this needs to be guarded to prevent any repeated initializations
- Blender's `bpy.msgbus.subscribe_rna` method to subscribe to RNA property changes
  - How they have to be re-subscribed during new file loads using `bpy.app.handlers.load_post.append`
- Blender's collection property can be looked up by `name` using the `find` method, but the key name is immutable, so it needs to be saved for `O(1)` lookups
- `_ipython_key_completions_` method that allows key completions in IPython - for subscriptable access, `__dir__` method to control what attributes can be shown and `__iter__` for iterable support
- Blender's support for mix-in classes to simplify UI panelss
- Showing a confirmation dialog (`window_manager.invoke_confirm`) or a properties dialog (`window_manager.invoke_props_dialog`) while invoking Blender operators, concept of the `poll` that determines panel visibility
- A bit about `pytest` - setup and cleanup using fitures (and `yield`) and writing basic tests
- A bit about [quarto](https://quarto.org){:target="_blank"}
- Jupyter Notebooks with Blender kernel and caveats

Next week, I plan to start working on styles support. I started a [GSoC 2025: Styles support for MDA Universes
#879](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/MolecularNodes/discussions/879){:target="_blank"} discussion to outline some of the approaches.
