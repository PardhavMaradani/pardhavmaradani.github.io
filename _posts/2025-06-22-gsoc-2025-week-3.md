I made some decent progress this week:

- Created PR [#882](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/MolecularNodes/pull/882){:target="_blank"} to add basic trajectory API as described in this discussion [comment](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/MolecularNodes/discussions/870#discussioncomment-13466894){:target="_blank"} - merged
- Created PR [#887](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/MolecularNodes/pull/887){:target="_blank"} to add UI in the 3D viewport to manage entities as outlined in this discussion [comment](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/MolecularNodes/discussions/870#discussioncomment-13516446){:target="_blank"} - merged
- Created PR [#888](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/MolecularNodes/pull/888){:target="_blank"} to add Trajectory styles API as described in this discussion [comment](https://github.com/BradyAJohnston/MolecularNodes/discussions/879#discussioncomment-13467304){:target="_blank"}. A common styles UI for both Trajectory and Molecule entities is added - in review

Here is a short video that shows the progress made so far (only GUI, not API shown here):

Here are some learnings from this week:

- Blender's `UIList` has a way to both filter (using bit fields) and re-order items using the `filter_items` method. There are also some helper methods that Blender provides in `bpy.types.UI_UL_list` that helps both. The management of active index of the selected item in the `UIList` becomes tricky in case of filtering
- Any object can be used as a `owner` for Blender's `msgbus` subscriptions using `bpy.msgbus.subscribe_rna`. Using a owner allows to clear all subscriptions by the owner using `bpy.msgbus.clear_by_owner`
- Blender has a concept of `Restricted Context` during an extension's `register()` and `unregister()` methods that limits what is available during those methods. For example, the `scene` entity does not exist in `bpy.context` in these cases
- An object's `hide_viewport` property is not animatable. To support visibility changes that are animatable, a custom property (with `get` and `set` callbacks) that controls both the viewport and rendering visibility works better
- `window_manager.invoke_confirm` in an operator's `invoke` is used for confirmation dialogs
- `window_manager.invoke_props_dialog` in an operator's `invoke` is used to show a dialog with the operator properties. An explicit `draw` method can be used to customize the layout of what is shown
- The `execute` method of operators can be directly invoked (bypassing `invoke` etc) using the first param as `EXEC_DEFAULT` - this is very useful in tests to test operators

Next week, I will address any remaining issues with style management APIs and get started on outlining the next steps for adding annotation support.
