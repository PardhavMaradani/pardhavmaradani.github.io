I participated in [CodeCup 2025](https://www.codecup.nl/){:target="_blank"}. In 2025, the game for the context is [Box](https://www.codecup.nl/box/rules.php){:target="_blank"}. This was my first time participating in CodeCup.

CodeCup provides a system called [Caia](https://www.codecup.nl/download_caia.php){:target="_blank"}{:target="_blank"} that allows contestants to test and improve their bots for the test and final competitions. As a fun little side project, I built an unofficial online multiplayer version that allowed contestants to have their programs (bots) play against other programs **online** without having to share their source code or program binaries - their programs ran locally on their own systems and **only** the game moves were transmitted to the other players.

The application was built as a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/){:target="_blank"} application and here is how the overall architecture looked like:

Here is a sample of how the user interface at the client side looked like after starting the `Node.js` application:

All the code for this is open sourced and more details about this can be found in my [cc25-box-online-multiplayer](https://github.com/PardhavMaradani/cc25-box-online-multiplayer){:target="_blank"} GitHub repo. [Tapani Utriainen](https://www.codecup.nl/entrygames.php?ent=9862){:target="_blank"}, a fellow contestant contributed the code for calculating the ELO rating and [Maks Verver](https://github.com/maksverver){:target="_blank"}, another fellow contestant contributed code to support reverse proxies.

My own submission for the contest can be found in the following [gist](https://gist.github.com/PardhavMaradani/8736c25cf70e36292204ec27058c213f){:target="_blank"}. It was a pretty basic version with weights based on the overall geometric structure with negative weights against all other colors till the opponent color is guessed. A lot of other contestants also shared their code in the CodeCup forum and there was a lot I learnt from them.
