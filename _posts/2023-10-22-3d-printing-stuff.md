My younger brother ([Pranav Maradani](https://www.youtube.com/@PranavMaradani){:target="_blank"}) and I got a 3D printer in April 2022. It is an [Ender-3 S1](https://www.creality.com/products/creality-ender-3-s1-3d-printer){:target="_blank"} (the one in picture above). Before that, we'd model the prints but had to rely on a 3D printing service to get them printed (like the ones in the [Prakriya '22 Souvenir post]({% post_url 2022-04-02-prakriya-souvenir %}){:target="_blank"}).

Here is me unpacking and setting up the new 3D printer:

We modelled and printed lots of stuff. Here is a collage of some of them:

We modelled a lot of them in Blender. Blender's [3D Print Toolbox](https://extensions.blender.org/add-ons/print3d-toolbox/){:target="_blank"} addon was invaluable during that process to check for any errors before exporting the `stl` files and slicing them. Here is a collage of some of these models:

> The collages above are based on the idea of a `Voronoi Collage` from the [Interactive Voronoi]({% post_url 2020-07-19-interactive-voronoi %}){:target="_blank"} post and an unfinshed version of a browser based voronoi collage maker to generate them - I will hopefully complete it at some point and share
